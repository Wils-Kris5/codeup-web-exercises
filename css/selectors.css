/*A style definition starts with a selector. Following the selector is an open and a close curly brace.
Inside the curly braces is a list of key:value pairs. As we saw in the last lesson,
the key:value pairs have a colon between them, and a semi-colon after them.
 The key is the name of a CSS property, and the value is the value of the property is being used.*/
