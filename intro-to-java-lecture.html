//-Java is an Object-Oriented language. This means that objects are the primary method of composition in the language. We'll explore this in more detail in the Java II section.
//Java runs (almost) everywhere.
//   Components:
//           [  JDK=Java Development Kit ]
//            ^                           ^

//  ================================= JAVA INTRO READING QUESTIONS
//What is the difference between a .java and .class file?
//    >.java file.
//
//This is plain-text, human-readable code.The source code is compiled.Next the .java file is compiled with the javac tool.
//While it is good to know about javac, practically speaking, you won't interact with it much directly.
//Rather, an IDE (like IntelliJ) or a build tool (like maven) will automate it's usage for you.
//
//
//Why are we using an IDE (IntelliJ) instead of a simple text editor for writing Java code?
//  IDEs are the de-facto standard for writing Java code. This is primarily due to the automation of the compile-run process,
//      and rich autocompletion and code analysis tools.
//
//
//What is the difference between a JRE and a JDK?
//  - the JRE is necessary to run Java applications
//  - the JDK is necessary to create and build Java applications
//
//
//Are we currently learning about JavaSE, JavaEE, JavaME, or JavaFX?
//
//
//
//
//What are some key differences between JavaScript and Java?
//  - Java is compiled while JavaScript is interpreted.
//- Java is statically typed while JavaScript has dynamic typing.
//- While JavaScript does have objects, there is much more focus on them in Java, and the way they are defined and used is quite different.
//- JavaScript runs (mostly) in the browser, while Java runs almost everywhere.
//
//
//
//
//
//Describe in some detail the process by which a Java program is able to run on an operating system.
//
//Why is Java touted as a “write once, run anywhere” language?
//
//
//(Note there are many ways to run a Java file). IntelliJ will first compile your HelloWorld.java file, then execute the compiled code.
